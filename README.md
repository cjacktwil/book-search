## Installation
Clone the repo and run 'npm install'.

## Usage
Users can browse books without logging in, but to fully utilize the app's functionality, a user must sign up/log in. 

Once logged in, a user can search through the Google book database by typing a search term in the search box. Users can save books to their personal list, and view those books by clicking the "See Your Books" link. 

Users can also delete books from the "See Your Books" link. 

The application is built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It has been deployed to Heroku using MongoDB Cloud.
